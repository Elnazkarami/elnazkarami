## 🧠 About Me

I’m Elnaz Alikarami, a Neuroscience Researcher & Data Enthusiast, with a strong interest in computational neuroscience. I previously worked on human brain imaging and now focus on data management and research coordination in neuroscience labs. 
I enjoy bridging experimental and computational approaches, building efficient systems for scientific data, and exploring how smart data practices can accelerate discovery in brain research.
